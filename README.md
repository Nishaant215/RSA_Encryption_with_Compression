# RSA_Encryption_with_Compression

This script demonstrate RSA encryption algorithm with compression. The compression of the plaintext happens before encryption.

The plain text is encoded to numbers: a=00 b=01 c=02 d=03.... Then compression is applied to the encoded number set. Next, the RSA Encryption algorithm is applied to encrypt the message (compressed encoded number set).
